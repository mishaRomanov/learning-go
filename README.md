# a small readme for my self made telegram bot project 
in this particular repository i will try to make a telegram bot with open Wikipedia and some free translate api. the bot will parse the requested information in wikipedia in russian and, if found, will display the result and suggest you to save the page. 
if such info was not found on russian wikipedia, it will ask you if you would like to automatically translate it to english and search for result once again. 
you can also keep your liked pages as bookmark: the bot will display them once asked to do so.
